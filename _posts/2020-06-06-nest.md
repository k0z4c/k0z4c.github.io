## **Getting Access**

As always, we start with

```bash
nmap -p- -sV -O -Pn -n -vv -oA nmap/nest_all nest
```
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/nmap.png %})

What that strange 4386 port is about?
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/hqk.png %})

Mmm... let's go forward

The null session vulnerability seems working; we can find interesting files on the data share 
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/interesting_files.png %})

Let's grab those files for further invastigation
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/smbget_data.png %})

Grepping the downloaded files we can find some creds!
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/creds1.png %})

Now we try to see if the found creds are working on smb
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/smb_secure.png %})

Oh yeah! We have the access to the secure$ share; nice!

Inspecting furhter, turns out that we can access an IT folder inside the Secure$ share; we download it then
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/it_folder.png %})

Let's grep for interesting things again
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/other_creds.png %})

Seems some new creds for a c.smith user in a config file.. but the password seems crypted so definetively unusable yet. 

After bangin' my head against the wall for some time, tryin to get a clue, i found 
that in the file NotepadPlusPlus/config.xml there was some kind of browsed files history recorded.
The user accessed some files with the editor, but one is particularly interesting:

![]({% link assets/htb/nest/share_notepad.png %})

Let's then try to list the content of the directory Carl under the Secure$/IT folder
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/smb_carl.png %})

Very good! let's work on it locally
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/carl_download.png %})

RUScanner uh? I tried then to search for the file RU_Config.xml, i.e. the one where we found the encrypted password of C.smith
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/ruconfig.png %})

Yep; so the RU scanner project uses the creds on the conf file decrypting them at run time
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/rudecrypt.png %})

## **Privilege escalation to c.smith**

At this point, rassembling the visual basic source code of the RU scanner project just to use the "decrypt" function
(i.e. we inserted the main function at the bottom of the script)

Voila' ! So now we have decrypted that goddamn' password 
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/csmithpass.png %})

## **Privilege escalation to Administrator**

Let's use the user csmith to access the shares again and see if we can grab smth interesting
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/debug_smith.png %})

It seems so.. the highlighted file seems very interesting!
Unfortunately there's nothing inside.. but there's nuthing only if you dont know the existence of NFS alternate data streams!
In fact
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/datapass.png %})

So let's retrieve te file and read the password data stream
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/hqpass.png %})

Now we can use the password for the HQK Reporting service that we were talking to with telnet and activate the debug mode.
Thanks to the debug mode, we can move to upper directories and find the LDAP one.. Inside there was a conf file with
encrypted administrator credentials... yeah, encrypted, again (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/ldappass.png %})

So I downloaded the HqkLdap.exe file in the "Hqk reporting/AD Integration module" directory, to see if the encrypted password was
decrypted on runtime with the help of dnspy .NET debugger.

The main function was here  
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/dnspy_main.PNG %})  

And was like this  
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/dnspy.PNG %})  

So I monkey patched the class, removing the highlighted dependency and putting in a file the previously found credentials
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/dnspy_patched.PNG %})

Then I put a breakpoint and ran the exe
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/dnspy_password_dec.PNG %})

Tada! 

Now we can mount the C$ share as Administrator and read the flag 
![]({% link assets/htb/nest/root.png %})

Rooted. Cya (:
