### **Hello friend**,
here is **Matt** (:

This blog was in the back o' my mind, for a long time..  
For now, I have decided to upload some hackthebox walkthroughs.  
In the future, I'd like to talk 'bout more broad security topics, too. 
 
#### Now, let's talk about me, for a lil while..

Actually, I'm working as a **_pentester_** for a consulting agency.  
I've matured a good grasp and experience about **_enterprise assessment_** on:
* **_Web Application_**
* **_Infrastructural_**  

..Done some **_Red Teaming_** experiences, too.

My interests rounds mainly about **_Offensive Security_** and **_Forensics_**.

If you're interested in getting in touch with me:
* <a href="mailto: matteo.sondrio@gmail.com">**matteo.sondrio@gmail.com**</a>, if you're looking for a project collaborator or just an HTB buddy.
* [**LinkedIn**][linkedin_link], if you're an head hunter, feel free to ping me there.

.. Cya!
